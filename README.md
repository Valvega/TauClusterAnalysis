# VLL Run-2 Search
Code to analyze MC and data to search for vector-like lepton pairs, each decaying into a tau lepton and a long-lived pseudoscalar

## Make histograms

A script template of how to read the ntuples and make histograms is Study_TauProperties.py. The command to run it is the following: 
````
python Study_TauProperties.py --config config/configuration_2018.cfg --tag taustudies --maxnevents 10000
````
where 
````
--config     The configuration file with the information about the inputs/output/year directories
--tag        the name of the output folder (defined by user)
--maxnevents the maximum number of events to be processed (all by default)
````

## Make bkg studies
A script template of how to read the ntuples and bkg studies is Study_BkgComposition.py. The command to run it is the following: 
````
python Study_BkgComposition.py --config config/configuration_2018.cfg --tag bkgtudies --maxnevents 10000
````
where 
````
--config     The configuration file with the information about the inputs/output/year directories,bkg samples, cross sections
--tag        The name of the output folder (defined by user)
--maxnevents The maximum number of events to be processed (all by default)
